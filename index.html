                        <h3>Challenges/Problems Statement</h3>
                        <p>The website for <span><a href="https://sosforhumanitarianactions.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The SOS for Humanitarian Actions</a></span> was intended to provide donors with a place to donate to the organization, and to provide information about the organizations services to those in need. However, the site is so outdated and garish that is it difficult to find any information easily and users are distrustful of its legitimacy. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>We will redesign with the goal of giving the site a trustworthy appearance and making the information easier to find. </p>
                            <p>We will rebranding the site with pleasing and comforting logos, colors, and images.</p>
                            <p>we will build new forms and donation links in order to promote increased donations and volunteer opportunities.</p>

                    <img src="/asset/caseStudy1/Interviews.jpg">
                    <p>We made the Guerrilla Testing Plan before we started to redesign the website. We had 4 tasks for user testing: make a donation, find companies address, read mission statements, and use the search bar. We believe that making a donation is one of the main things for non-profit websites. We wanted to know how users learned about this website and what interactions they had when they wanted to make a donation.
                        We had 5 user testings, and we organized the user test results into Affinity Diagrams.

                    <p>
                        We started to capture the pain points. The users had a hard time to trust this website, because the website looks unprofessional. The design of the website made most users uncomfortable to browse. Also, the way they showed two different languages in the website confused most of the users.
                        For digging more user’s needs and pain points, we even did Empathy Map, “I like, I wish, What if” map, and Feature Prioritization Matrix.</p>

                        The user was a 45 year old interior designer from a local area in GA. She has a passion to make the world better. She wants to start her action from the local area. One of the options is to make a donation through a legit non-profit website, and sign-up for community service if she has free time. The pain point is that she had a hard time finding a trustworthy non-profit website to reach her goal.

                    <p>We rethink the user flow for the site. We wanted to know what features and context they had in the original site. The user flow shows that three different paths depend on the user decision. Three different paths would be to make a donation, sign up for volunteer work, and look for help or public resources.
                            We made card sorting and did the sitemap for the menu system. This would help us to reorganize categories, and emitted the unnecessary categories in the menu. The original website has two languages, English and French, in the menu, and now we only keep English for the menu. We also performed a redlining of the site to gain a sense of the scope of the task we had before us, at least from a UI perspective. </p>

                        <p>We started with a mid-fidelity prototype, because we have a strong concept in our mind. We limited the menu options into five categories in the header. The user would not be confused by the overwhelming categories’ menu. We added the footer to the site that helps for better navigation. We picked the hero image from the original website’s picture which they already had. Made the donation button into a red color that would make people feel called to action. We did a lot of alignment and rewording statements that helped users understand this non-profit more. One of the challenges is that the website is not a responsive website, so we spend a lot of time making both versions, desktop and mobile.</p>

                    <p>From the first time our team laid eyes on this site, it was apparent that it desperately needed a redesign. We instantly became excited with all the possibilities that came to mind for the opportunity in front of us.  We are confident that our hard work has transformed this unprofessional and untrustworthy website into something that anyone visiting would feel confident in donating their time and money to S.O.S for Humanitarian Actions.

                            The next step for our site redesign would be to work with S.O.S. for Humanitarian Actions directly and expand the site to fit their growing needs. We hope that any non-profit, whether large or small, will be encouraged by our work and strive to make their own sites the best that they can be.</p>
