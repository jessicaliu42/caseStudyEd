                        <p><span><a href="https://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">The US Department of Education</a></span>’s website is provided by the US government. It provides educational information to support students and educators, such as student loans, grants, educational law, or education data..etc. My challenge in this project is to discover the pain points when users navigated the Ed.gov site. </p>                        
                        <h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>We will redesign with the goal of giving the site a trustworthy appearance and making the information easier to find. </p>
                            <p>We will rebranding the site with pleasing and comforting logos, colors, and images.</p>
                            <p>we will build new forms and donation links in order to promote increased donations and volunteer opportunities.</p>

                                The user was a 45 year old interior designer from a local area in GA. She has a passion to make the world better. She wants to start her action from the local area. One of the options is to make a donation through a legit non-profit website, and sign-up for community service if she has free time. The pain point is that she had a hard time finding a trustworthy non-profit website to reach her goal.

                    <p>We made the Guerrilla Testing Plan before we started to redesign the website. We had 4 tasks for user testing: make a donation, find companies address, read mission statements, and use the search bar. We believe that making a donation is one of the main things for non-profit websites. We wanted to know how users learned about this website and what interactions they had when they wanted to make a donation.
                        We had 5 user testings, and we organized the user test results into Affinity Diagrams.

                    <p>We started with a mid-fidelity prototype, because we have a strong concept in our mind. We limited the menu options into five categories in the header. The user would not be confused by the overwhelming categories’ menu. We added the footer to the site that helps for better navigation. We picked the hero image from the original website’s picture which they already had. Made the donation button into a red color that would make people feel called to action. We did a lot of alignment and rewording statements that helped users understand this non-profit more. One of the challenges is that the website is not a responsive website, so we spend a lot of time making both versions, desktop and mobile.</p>

                    <p>I have to say I am lucky, because Department of Education’s website has a lot of designs that needs to improve. The site’s user experience is not friendly shows in the testing results. When we were conducted testing with users, most of users have trouble to finish tasks successfully. Testings’ results gave me ideas what needs to improve in this site. 
                            After I started to redesign, I still wanted to keep some of nice features and colors from original design. I choose same colors-grey blue and light green for color palette. I added more pictures in the homepage, because it’s text-heavy to the user, even to me. 
                            The website is not mobile-first design, or I think they didn’t have mobile version. In my redesign, I decided to make mobile-first design. I sketched mobile version first, then started to rethink how would those features showed in the desktop version. 
                            I found out that the user really rely on the search bar so that I made search bar are easy to find. A lot of links are directed to outside’s websites without a notification. The user always have a hard time to go back to original website. I wish I could make that a notification that the user can click the link after chose to “Leave site”, then open new window in Figma, but I think Figma won’t able to hyperlink in the prototyping. The testings are very helpful, but unfortunately i still can’t have enough of time to do more testings.
                            In the future, I definitely continue my redesign. There’s still have more to do, such as make a filler for student loans and grants when student want to search…etc. 
                            Overall, I like this project.</p>
